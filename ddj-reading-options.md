## Single articles worth reading

[**1 dataset, visualized 25 ways**](http://flowingdata.com/2017/01/24/one-dataset-visualized-25-ways/) by [Nathan Yau (Flowing Data)](https://twitter.com/flowingdata): For some reason, people love maps. And there seems to be the urge to make many visualization as a map that would have been way more effective in telling the story as another visual form. Nathan Yau's post shows how the story the visual tells changes depending on it's form - as you can see there's not just one or two but 25 ways to visualize the same data.

[**What Questions to ask when creating charts**](https://blog.datawrapper.de/better-charts/): If you are new to the data visualization topic, this step-by-step workflow by [Lisa Charlotte Muth](https://twitter.com/lisacrost?lang=en) on Datawrapper's [Blog](https://blog.datawrapper.de/) guide is a good place to start and get some guidance!

[**The magical number 7, plus or minus 2**](http://www.psych.utoronto.ca/users/peterson/psy430s2001/Miller%20GA%20Magical%20Seven%20Psych%20Review%201955.pdf) by George Miller: This is a 1955 paper about how many different colors (or tones) humans are able to distinguish and remember. Entertainingly written (for a scientific paper) and a great case for not overloading your visual!

[**Difference between median and mean**](https://blog.datawrapper.de/weekly-chart-income/): Another one by [Lisa Charlotte Muth](https://twitter.com/lisacrost?lang=en) on Datawrapper's [Blog](https://blog.datawrapper.de/) explains the difference between the two measures and I will redirect anyone asking to this, because it's explained thoroughly and visually appealing. Unlike any stats course you ever had. 

[**How to avoid 10 common mistakes in data reporting**](https://www.americanpressinstitute.org/publications/data-reporting-common-mistakes/) by the [American Press Institute](https://twitter.com/AmPress): There are probably many many more possible pitfalls you could tap in, however, if you have these 10 possibilities in your mind, you're off to a good start. Also: I believe that making mistakes in crucial to actually avoiding them, so don't be too hard on yourself if you're making mistakes.

**Interactives: Yes or no?** If you are a *little bit* into data journalism, you probably have heard about the discussion whether data visuals hould or can be still interactive. With the rise of mobile, desktop-full-screen interactives have a hard time - as they have to be downsized in features and functionality to fit on a mobile screen. So some practitioners like [Archie Tse](https://twitter.com/archietse?lang=en) make a case for [doing less interactives](https://github.com/archietse/malofiej-2016/blob/master/tse-malofiej-2016-slides.pdf). 

Then there was this one conference talk by [Gregor Aisch](https://twitter.com/driven_by_data?) where he said for one specific article only 15% of users clicked on one of the buttons - this turned into the [death of interactives](https://medium.com/@dominikus/the-end-of-interactive-visualizations-52c585dcafcb), Aisch wrote a piece in [defense of interactives](https://www.vis4.net/blog/2017/03/in-defense-of-interactive-graphics/) and now what? Cutting the long story short, I'm part of the party that argues for using interactives when you *have* to (as in: three static dimensions are not enough) and that you always have in mind not to hide information crucial to your story behind interactive elememts. 


## Books

[**Data Journalism Handbook**](https://datajournalismhandbook.org/) published by the [European Journalism Centre](http://ejc.net/) and the [Open Knowledge Foundation](https://okfn.org/): The [**Handbook's first edition**](https://datajournalism.com/read/handbook/one) dates back to March 2012, a [**second edition**](https://datajournalism.com/read/handbook/two) was released in March 2021.

[**ODECA Data Journalism Manual**](https://web.archive.org/web/20171019181209/https://odecanet.org/data-journalism-manual/) by [Eva Constantaras](https://twitter.com/evaconstantaras): Written with especially an Eastern Europe and Central Asian audience in mind!

[**The Functional Art**](https://www.amazon.com/Functional-Art-introduction-information-visualization/dp/0321834739/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1516545187&sr=1-1&keywords=functional+art) by [Alberto Cairo](https://twitter.com/albertocairo?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor): This was the first book I ever read on data visualization and data-driven journalism - and it was eye-opening. So for everyone who wants to get a grip on these topics, this one is highly recommended! Cairo explains what makes a chart effective and highlights the role of storytelling. If you want to check it out, here's a [free sample](http://ptgmedia.pearsoncmg.com/images/9780321834737/samplepages/0321834739.pdf). He also has written a follow-up, [the Truthful Art](https://www.amazon.com/Truthful-Art-Data-Charts-Communication/dp/0321934075) and has put a [free sample](https://www.dropbox.com/s/sno2s7r4wdnitdf/1TruthfulArtFIRSTPAGES.pdf?dl=0) online.

[**The Washington Post Information Graphics Guide**](https://www.amazon.com/Street-Journal-Guide-Information-Graphics/dp/0393347281) by Dona Wong: Whereas the above recommendation is more general (though with many examples), this guide by Dona Wong is very specific: What font sizes, color pairs, layout does the WaPo use in its graphics? For everyone stepping into data visualization it can be super useful as a blueprint to develop sort of a design guide for oneself, so you don't have to make the same design choices all over again with every chart you produce.

[**Finding stories in spreadsheets**](https://leanpub.com/spreadsheetstories) by [Paul Bradshaw](https://twitter.com/paulbradshaw): When talking to journalists who never heard of ddj before, they often have the false perception that the goal is a report citing tons of numbers. It takes some time to twist their perspective and convince them that finding stories *in* data is a) possible b) [useful](https://advent17.journocode.com/door/22/) and c) doesn't result in a dry academic text you fall asleep over while reading. My favourite moment is seeing them realizing the potential and being enthusiastic about all the opportunities they suddenly see.

[**Interactive Data Visualisation for the Web (d3.js)**](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/interactive-data-visualization/9781491921296/) by [Scott Murray](https://twitter.com/scotthmurray): Once the three dimensions a static visualization has are not enough to convey the data-story you want to tell it's time to go interactive. The means to do that usually is d3.js, a javascript library commonly used to interactively visualizse data. Scott Murray has written this introduction, teaching you the basics step by step.

[**Visual Display of Quantitative Information**](https://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/books_vdqi) by Edward Tufte: You don't have to agree with Tufte's minimalist approach to visualization, but you should at least know about his philosopy and the idea of the data-ink-ratio.

[**How not to be wrong: The Power of Mathematical Thinking**](https://www.amazon.de/gp/product/0143127535/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) by [Jordan Ellenberg](http://www.math.wisc.edu/~ellenber/): Because the "I was bad at math back in school" is a lame argument made by too many journalists. This book is super entertainingly written and anything but a dry math lecture. Also: who does not want not to be wrong?!
